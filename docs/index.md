## Introduction
Formeo is an extensible form editor written in vanilla Javascript. It builds on years of experience in creating [formBuilder](https://formbuilder.online/) and implements many of the feature requests received for that plug-in. A great deal a focus went into API development for Formeo to make almost every part of it pluggable.

### Features

- Column/inline field support
  - generate layouts for your form's fields
  - numerous presets for common layouts and resizable for custom layouts
- Conditional fields
  - programmatically hide/show or change row, column or field values
  - works with external data
- Controls API
  - create forms with signature pads, interactive maps and more
  - extend or clone the built-in controls
- External Data
  - User session information in your forms such as name
  - Dynamic data like remotely loaded select options
- Rendering
  - render your form template using the same renderer used to generate the Formeo UI
  - or BYOR (Bring Your Own Renderer) to render form template data using third-party libraries.
